A space bunny in its natural habitat. One of my first attempts at accelerating collision tests using an AABB tree. Rendering this scene with no anti-aliasing took little more than a second after the AABB tree, and a little under 30 before the AABB tree, yielding an improvement by a factor of about 30.
